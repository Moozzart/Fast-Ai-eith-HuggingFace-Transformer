The chosen task is a multi-class text classification on Movie Reviews. For each text movie review, the model has to predict a label for the sentiment. We evaluate the outputs of the model on classification accuracy. The sentiment labels are:  0 → Negative 1 → Somewhat negative 2 → Neutral 3 → Somewhat positive 4 → Positive. This movie review dataset(provided by Kaggle) is more complex than the generic movie review dataset
